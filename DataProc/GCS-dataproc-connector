Google Cloud Storage connector:
==================================
The Google Cloud Storage connector lets you run Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark jobs directly on data in Cloud Storage, and offers a number of benefits over choosing the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

Benefits of the Cloud Storage connector:

Direct data access –
  Store your data in Cloud Storage and access it directly, with no need to transfer it into HDFS first.
HDFS compatibility –
  You can easily access your data in Cloud Storage using the gs:// prefix instead of hdfs://.
Interoperability –
  Storing data in Cloud Storage enables seamless interoperability between Spark, Hadoop, and Google services.
Data accessibility –
  When you shut down a Hadoop cluster, you still have access to your data in Cloud Storage, unlike HDFS.
High data availability –
  Data stored in Cloud Storage is highly available and globally replicated without a loss of performance.
No storage management overhead –
  Unlike HDFS, Cloud Storage requires no routine maintenance such as checking the file system,
  upgrading or rolling back to a previous version of the file system, etc.
Quick startup –
  In HDFS, a MapReduce job can't start until the NameNode is out of safe mode—a process that can take from a few seconds to
  many minutes depending on the size and state of your data. With Google Cloud Storage, you can start your job as soon as the task nodes start,
  leading to significant cost savings over time.
